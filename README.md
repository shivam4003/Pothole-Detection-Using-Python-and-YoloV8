# Road Eye - Real-Time Pothole Detection System

## Overview

Road Eye is a cutting-edge real-time pothole detection
- **Cost-Effective Road Maintenance**: Automated pothole detection helps in faster road assessments, which can reduce the costs associated with manual inspections.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Potholes can be detected and reported in real time, allowing immediate action from maintenance teams to prevent further damage.
- **Cross-Platform Integration**: The system is versatile and can be integrated into different types of devices, including **mobile apps**, **drones**, and **vehicle-mounted cameras** for a wide range of use cases.

## Model Training

The **YOLOv8** model was trained on a carefully curated dataset of annotated pothole images. The dataset consists of diverse road conditions and pothole types, making the model adaptable to different environments. The model was evaluated using several metrics:

- **Precision**: Measures the accuracy of the detected potholes.
- **Recall**: Assesses the ability of the model to detect all potholes.
- **mAP (mean Average Precision)**: Averages the precision across different Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds to evaluate overall performance.

## Installation

To run the **Road Eye** pothole detection system, follow these installation steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/road-eye.git
   cd road-eye
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies. Ensure you have Python and pip installed, and then run:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Install **YOLOv8** (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   pip install yolov8
   ```

4. Download the pre-trained model or use your own model trained with the custom dataset.

## Usage

To detect potholes in a given image or video, use the following command:

```bash
python detect_potholes.py --input <path_to_input_file> --output <path_to_output_file>
```

Where:
- `input` is the path to the image or video file you want to process.
- `output` is the path to save the output with detected potholes.

You can also use the system with real-time video streams or integrate it into mobile applications or drones for live pothole detection.
